# Small Management Program ![](https://travis-ci.org/micheleantonazzi/small_management_program.svg?branch=old-program)

This is the old version, without AspectJ and documentation. I'm slowly rewriting the entire program to update and improve it. My goals are:

* update the UI using FXML and
* use Aspect Oriented Programming.
